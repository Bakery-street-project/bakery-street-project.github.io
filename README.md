## Vision

The official website for Bakery Street Project (<https://bakery-street-project.github.io/>) is well-structured with essential documentation files such as `.github`, `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `index.html`. The project's vision involves a strategic planning approach divided into eight key areas:

- 1. **Analysis**: Understanding the current state and identifying strengths and weaknesses.
- 2. **Stack**: Determining the technologies and tools being used or should be considered.
- 3. **Missing**: Identifying gaps in functionality, features, or resources that are necessary for the project's success.
- 4. **Monetization**: Exploring how to generate revenue from the project, whether through donations, ads, subscriptions, or other models.
- 5. **Lua Potential**: Considering the use of Lua as a potential scripting language within the project, its benefits and limitations.
